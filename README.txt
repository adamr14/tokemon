for our final project. Please extract all the files from the submitted zip file onto your 
local drive.

For our checkpoint 2, we have made a lot of progress in the actual gameplay, game mechanics, and 
visuals of Hokiemon. The game starts out spawning the player in their home. Inside their home, 
the player can either heal their HokieMon at the table or exit the house. Once outside, the player 
can explore the map freely. There are patches of wild grass, trees, fences, and a path to direct 
the player. 

Game mechanics including battling and gaining experience to level up have been implemented. When 
the player walks into the wild grass a fight is initiated with a random HokieMon. The type is 
selected from a global array. The player will battle a pokemon relative to all of their pokemons 
level. Currently the only options available in the fight scene is attack or run away. The 
HokieMon’s damage vary by chance and their level. If the player defeats a wild HokieMon they 
gain experience. Leveling up their HokieMon increases its damage as well as health. If the player 
loses all of their HokieMon, they will respawn in their house with all of their HokieMon levels 
decreased by 1.  

Moving forward we still need to implement throwing a pokeball to attempt to catch a wild HokieMon, 
the ability to view inside your bag and change HokieMon during a battle, and the final trainer 
boss fight.
