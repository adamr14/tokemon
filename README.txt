Final Project Checkpoint #1
Saam Rezaei

ECE 4525

The index.html file will take you to a web browser displaying the first checkpoint
for our final project. In this checkpoint we created a title screen that displays
the game's title, authors, and main characters with animations. From the start screen,
you can view the instructions page by clicking the blue pokeball that says "Instructions".
When clicked, the instructions for general game play and battling as well as some tips
are shown in a series of pages inside an animated book. Different characters and objects
are also scattered throughout the pages of the instructions. 

NOTE: Please extract all the files from the submitted zip file onto your local drive.
